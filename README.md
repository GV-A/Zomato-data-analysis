This project explores a dataset from Zomato to analyze restaurant trends, user preferences, and service types using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn. The analysis addresses three key questions to gain insights into restaurant services and consumer behavior.
**Analysis Questions**

**1. Online vs. Offline Delivery**
To understand current trends, we analyzed whether more restaurants offer online delivery compared to offline-only services. This provides insights into consumer demand and restaurant adaptation to delivery options.

**2. Most Favored Types of Restaurants**
This analysis identifies the types of restaurants most popular among the general public, based on ratings and reviews, to highlight dining preferences.

**3. Preferred Price Range for Couples**
To determine typical spending for couples, we explored the preferred price ranges for dinner settings, offering insights for restaurants targeting this demographic.
